nopc.name= nopc - Naked Objects Property (common)
nopc.desc= \
Creates the most commonly used methods only for a property. \
<p>Other supporting methods can be created using the <tt>nops</tt> \
template.  Alternatively the full set of methods can be created using the \
<tt>nopf</tt> template. \
<p>The members created are: \
<ul> \
<li> the instance variable holding the property</li> \
<li> accessor method (getter)</li> \
<li> mutator method (setter)</li> \
<li> <tt>modify</tt> method - to modify the value held by the property</li> \
<li> <tt>clear</tt> method - to set the value to <tt>null</tt></li> \
</ul> \
<p>The <tt>modify</tt> and <tt>clear</tt> are optional, but it is good \
practice to include them.
