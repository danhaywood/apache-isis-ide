      conventions and supporting <a href="ch02s03.html#NO-Applib">annotations</a>
      for writing Java-based domain object models. These conventions are
      required so that an <a href="ch02s01.html#NO-ArchitecturalPattern">NOA</a>
      framework can interact with the domain objects in a well-defined
      manner.</p><p>These programming conventions build upon <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Java_Object" target="_top">POJO /
      JavaBean</a> naming conventions; in particular they do not require
      the domain objects to subclass from any framework-specific superclass.
      Moreover these conventions are compatible with those of Hibernate/EJB3,
      meaning that NOA implementations (such as the Naked Objects Framework)
      can use Hibernate for persistence.</p><p>The key programming conventions are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>properties are represented by accessors
          (<code class="computeroutput">getXxx</code>) and mutator
          (<code class="computeroutput">setXxx</code>) methods, just as for
          JavaBeans. These may be called either via the UI or via an object
          store implementation when it is resolving an object.</p><p>The accessors and mutators may be supplemented by a
          <code class="computeroutput">modifyXxx</code> and
          <code class="computeroutput">clearXxx</code> methods which the NOA
          implementation will invoke instead of the mutator if present. These
          allow additional functionality to be performed (for example
          maintaining derived object state).</p><p>Optionally a <code class="computeroutput">validateXxx</code>
          method can be used to validate and if necessary veto any proposed
          new values for a property. If a property should be read-only (for
          example, because of the state that the object is in) then it can be
          disabled using a <code class="computeroutput">disableXxx</code> method,
          or it can be hidden completely from the UI using a
          <code class="computeroutput">hideXxx</code> method.</p><p>Finally a default value (for a newly created object) can be
          specified using a <code class="computeroutput">defaultXxx</code>
          method, and if there is a enumeration of valid values (eg as might
          be rendered through a drop-down list) then a
          <code class="computeroutput">choicesXxx</code> method can specify these
          values.</p></li><li><p>collections are likewise represented by accessors
          (<code class="computeroutput">getXxx</code>) and mutator
          (<code class="computeroutput">
                     <code class="computeroutput">setXxx</code>
                  </code>)
          methods, though the return type here is a collection (ie
          <code class="computeroutput">java.util.List</code> or
          <code class="computeroutput">java.util.Set</code>).</p><p>As for properties the accessors and mutators may be
          supplemented by <code class="computeroutput">addToXxx</code> and
          <code class="computeroutput">removeFromXxx</code> methods. The NOA
          implementation will invoke these if present rather than act directly
          on the collection provided by the getter.</p><p>The <code class="computeroutput">validateAddToXxx</code> and
          <code class="computeroutput">validateRemoveFromXxx</code> methods can
          be used to validate and if necessary veto any proposed changed to
          the contents of a collection. And again as for properties, a
          <code class="computeroutput">disableXxx</code> and hideXxx method can
          be used to respectively make a collection read-only or to hide it
          from the UI completely.</p></li><li><p>actions of a method are any other
          <code class="computeroutput">public</code> methods. Again these can be
          supplemented by a number of supporting methods.</p><p>The <code class="computeroutput">validateXxx</code> method is
          used to validate the parameter values of an action prior to invoking
          it. The <code class="computeroutput">disableXxx</code> method can
          prevent the action from being invoked in the first place while the
          <code class="computeroutput">hideXxx</code> method removes it from the
          GUI.</p><p>Any default values for the parameters of an action can be
          specified using a <code class="computeroutput">defaultXxx</code>
          method, while any enumeration of valid values for those parameters
          can be specified using a <code class="computeroutput">choiceXxx</code>
          method.</p></li><li><p>a no-arg constuctor is required.</p></li></ul></div><p>The <a href="ch04s04.html#Templates">template</a> functionality
      provided by the NO IDE greatly assists in ensuring that the supporting
      methods are correctly named and so forth.</p><p>These key naming conventions are backed up by a number of Java 5
      annotations that can be used on properties, collections and actions. For
      example, the <code class="computeroutput">@Named</code> annotation can be
      applied to a parameter of an action method so that it is rendered
      appropriately, whereas the
      <code class="computeroutput">@Immutable(When.ONCE_PERSISTED)</code> allows
      an object to be edited until it has been initially saved, but not
      thereafter. These Java 5 annotations reside in the <a href="ch02s03.html#NO-Applib">Naked Objects application library</a>. One reason
      that the <a href="ch04s01.html#ProjectWizards">project wizards</a> separate
      out the application project from the client project is to minimize the
      dependencies of the domain objects to just the Naked Objects application
      library, and not the remainder of the Naked Objects Framework (or
      indeed, any other NOA-compliant implementation).</p><p>In addition, there are a number of optional methods. The first two
      are used to identify the object in the UI, and the last relates to
      validation:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>the <code class="computeroutput">title()</code> method returns a
          string which the UI is expected to use as a label for the object. If
          not present then <code class="computeroutput">toString()</code> is
          used.</p></li><li><p>the <code class="computeroutput">iconName()</code> method returns
          a string which represents the icon to show for the label. This is
          much less commonly used than title() because normally NOA
          implementations allow an icon to be associated with the class rather
          than an instance of a class. For example, the NOF uses an image file
          whose name matches that of the domain class (eg
          <code class="computeroutput">Customer.gif</code>). Nevertheless, the
          <code class="computeroutput">iconName()</code> method allows the icon
          to change on a per-instance basis, eg according to the state of the
          object.</p></li><li><p>the <code class="computeroutput">validate()</code> method can be
          used to veto any changes to the object. This is useful when there
          are two properties whose values must be consistent with each other,
          eg FromDate &lt; ToDate.</p></li></ul></div><p>There are a number of other methods that are defined which relate
      to managing the lifecycle of the object in respect to its environment.
      See <a href="">Domain Object Container</a> for further
      discussion.</p></div></body></html>
