      wizards</a> are OSGi (plugin) projects rather than regular Java
      projects. In most respects these function exactly the same as regular
      Java projects that you might be familiar with, however some of the
      project metadata (that would otherwise be accessed using
      <code class="computeroutput">Project&gt;Properties...&gt;Java Build
      Path</code>) are instead moved into the OSGi manifest which
      resides in <code class="computeroutput">META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code>. This
      can be opened in the Eclipse PDE (Plugin Development Environment)
      manifest editor:</p><p>The principle difference is the means by which the classpath is
      setup. For more details on the practicalities of this, see the <a href="ch03s09.html#TasksUpdateClasspath">Tasks</a> section.</p><p>Why are OSGi projects used rather than regular projects? For the
      developer (you):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The NOF runtime itself and the NOF runtime's prerequisites are
          developed internally as OSGi projects which means that they can be
          packaged up as Eclipse features and made available using Eclipse's
          update site feature. From your point of view, the NOF libraries are
          just "there".</p></li><li><p>Since the NOF runtime source is also packaged as an Eclipse
          feature, the developer can step into the NOF library source code
          directly without any additional setup.</p></li><li><p>Using Eclipse update sites makes it easy to update to new
          releases of the NOF runtime as they become available.</p></li></ul></div><p>For the NOF/NO IDE development team (us), the benefits are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>It makes it substantially easier to implement new viewers
          based on Eclipse RCP.</p></li><li><p>It provides a basis for other NOA implementations to follow.
          These too can leverage Eclipse technologies, for example using
          <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/rsp/" target="_top">RSP</a> or
          <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/" target="_top">AspectJ</a>.</p></li><li><p>Since the NO IDE is itself a combination of plugin projects,
          it allows us to start sharing some of the code with the NOF itself,
          reducing the maintenance overhead going forward.</p></li></ul></div><p>The (minor) downsides to this approach are that:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Setting up the classpath for any third-party libraries becomes
          trickier because the vast majority are shipped as JAR files and not
          as OSGi bundles. You may therefore need to package them yourself -
          see <a href="ch03s09.html#TasksUpdateClasspath">tasks</a> for further
          details on how to do this. Alternatively, the JAR file may have
          already been converted and live in a repository; again there are
          more details in the <a href="ch03s09.html#TasksUpdateClasspath">tasks</a> section.</p></li><li><p>NOF applications are <a href="ch02s09.html#Deploying">deployed</a>
          using Maven rather than using Eclipse.</p><p>To deploy an NOF application to a web server (as opposed to
          running locally as a web) requires the use of Maven. For details of
          this consult the NOF documentation. However, this does mean that
          project dependencies must be maintained in two locations: in the
          project manifests, and in the Maven
          <code class="computeroutput">pom.xml</code> configuration files.</p></li><li><p>Whenever a class is created in a new package, then the package
          must be explicitly exported to allow other OSGi projects to access
          the file. This is done simply enough through the PDE manifest
          editor, or by editing the
          <code class="computeroutput">Export-Package</code> entry directly in
          the manifest. However, it can be easy to forget to do this.</p></li></ul></div></div></body></html>
