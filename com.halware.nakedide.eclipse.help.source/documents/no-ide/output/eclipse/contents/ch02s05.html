      defines a <code class="computeroutput">DomainObjectContainer</code>
      interface that allows domain objects to interact with their environment.
      Every NOA-compliant implementation is required to provide an
      implementation of this interface; from the point of view of the domain
      objects the container <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> the NOA framework.</p><p>In an ideal world there would be no requirement for domain objects
      to know about their container. While this is not enforced
      programmatically (there is no mandatory superclass to inherit from, for
      example), it <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> required for domain objects
      to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>notify the container when traversing a reference to another
          object (either property or collection)</p><p>This enables the container to lazily fetch the next object if
          required</p></li><li><p>notify the container whenever the object has been
          modified</p><p>This enables the container to persist any changes in the
          object back to its persistent object store.</p></li></ul></div><p>The <code class="computeroutput">DomainObjectContainer</code>'s
      <code class="computeroutput">resolve()</code> and
      <code class="computeroutput">objectChanged()</code> methods allow the
      domain object to do this. Under the Naked Objects Framework these do
      need to be called, and are incorporated into the <a href="ch04s04.html#Templates">templates</a> shipped with the NO IDE. However,
      other NOA implementations might implement this requirement another way,
      for example by using CG-Lib to proxy references (similar to Hibernate),
      or precompiling using AspectJ.</p><p>One of the key responsibilities of the container is to perform
      <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection" target="_top">dependency
      injection</a> on all domain objects. That is, a domain object can
      declare - via a setter method - that it requires a certain service (be
      it <a href="">a factory, a repository or some other
      service</a>). The container will then inject this service into the
      domain object.</p><p>In order to do this the container needs to be involved in the
      creation of all objects. For objects which were previously persisted and
      are being resolved the container gets this opportunity through the
      <code class="computeroutput">resolve()</code> method call. For
      newly-created objects though the creating object should invoke
      <code class="computeroutput">newTransientInstance()</code> (or more rarely
      <code class="computeroutput">newPersistentInstance()</code>) on the
      container, indicating the class of object to be instantiated. Again,
      other NOA implementations might use CG-Lib or AspectJ to meet this
      requirement.</p><p>Another method that many domain objects will need to invoke on the
      container is <code class="computeroutput">makePersistent()</code>. This is
      used to persist the object for the first time. An object can also
      determine if it has been persisted using
      <code class="computeroutput">isPersistent()</code>.</p><p>A small subset of domain objects are interested in tracking their
      lifecycle. For these the domain object may provide any or all of the
      following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
                  <code class="computeroutput">created()</code>
               </p><p>Indicates that the (still-transient) object has just been
          created.</p></li><li><p>
                  <code class="computeroutput">loading()</code> and
          <code class="computeroutput">loaded()</code>
               </p><p>Indicates that this persistent object is about to be, or has
          been loaded from the object store.</p></li><li><p>
                  <code class="computeroutput">saving()</code> and
          <code class="computeroutput">saved()</code>
               </p><p>Indicates that this still-transient object is about to be, or
          has been persisted for the first time into the object store</p></li><li><p>
                  <code class="computeroutput">updating()</code> and
          <code class="computeroutput">updated()</code>
               </p><p>Indicates that this persistent object is about to be, or has
          been updated in the object store.</p></li><li><p>
                  <code class="computeroutput">deleting()</code> and
          <code class="computeroutput">deleted()</code>
               </p><p>Indicates that this persistent object is about to be, or has
          been deleted from the object store</p></li></ul></div><p>Note that these methods are not part of any interface; if they are
      present then they will be called.</p><p>The container interface contains two further category of methods.
      The first allows the domain object to raise messages back to the user;
      how these are represented in the UI is dependent on the NOA
      implementation. These methods are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
                  <code class="computeroutput">informUser()</code>
               </p><p>Displays the specified message to the user, in a non-intrusive
          fashion.</p></li><li><p>
                  <code class="computeroutput">warnUser()</code>
               </p><p>Display the specified message as a warning to the user, in a
          more visible fashion, but without requiring explicit
          acknowledgement.</p></li><li><p>
                  <code class="computeroutput">raiseError()</code>
               </p><p>Display the specified message as an error to the user,
          ensuring that it is acknowledged.</p></li></ul></div><p>The last category of methods in the container relates to security.
      Here the <code class="computeroutput">DomainObjectContainer</code> provides
      just a single method, <code class="computeroutput">getUser()</code>. This
      returns a <code class="computeroutput">UserMemento</code>, part of the
      <a href="ch02s03.html#NO-Applib">Naked Objects application library</a>. From
      this the object can obtain a list of roles. Note however that it is
      generally bad practice to encode role information within a domain
      object. NOA-implementations are free to provide their own mechanisms for
      applying authorization in a manner that is transparent to the domain
      object; in particular the Naked Objects Framework does this.</p></div></body></html>
