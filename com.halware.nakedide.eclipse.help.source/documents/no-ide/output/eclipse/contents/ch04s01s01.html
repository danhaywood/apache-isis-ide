        Wizard</h3></div></div></div><p>The application project wizard is used to create new application
        projects containing domain objects and supporting <a href="ch02s06.html#Services">repositories, factories and other
        services</a>.</p><p>To invoke the wizard, use:
        <code class="computeroutput">File&gt;New...&gt;Project...&gt;Naked
        Objects&gt;Application Project</code>
            </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="resource/application-project-wizard-page-1.gif"></div><p>The wizard is based in large part on Eclipse's own plug-in
        project wizard; all projects created by the NO IDE are <a href="ch02s08.html#OsgiProjects">OSGi projects</a>. A slight refinement is
        that on the second page the Id field is greyed out, defaulting to the
        project name. This ensures that the bundle Id in the manifest
        (<code class="computeroutput">META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code>) is the same as
        the project name in the <code class="computeroutput">.project</code>
        file.</p><p>When the wizard completes, the workbench is placed into the
        <a href="ch04s02.html#NO-Perspective">Naked Objects perspective</a>. The
        <a href="ch04s09s02.html#NO-Nature">Naked Objects nature</a> is also attached
        on the project, which enables the <a href="ch04s05.html#ProjectBuilder">project builder</a> and the <a href="ch04s07.html#Refactorings">refactoring</a> support.</p><p>The classpath of the application project (as defined in the
        manifest) is minimally dependent on the <a href="ch02s03.html#NO-Applib">Naked Objects application library</a> and a
        very small subset of 3rd party libraries (namely
        <code class="computeroutput">javax.persistence</code> for the
        <code class="computeroutput">@Entity</code> annotation, JUnit and Apache
        log4j).</p><p>As well as setting up the skeleton of the project, the wizard
        also creates some domain classes and services for an example project.
        As the <a href="ch01.html#Tutorial">tutorial</a> shows, the 3 project
        wizards work together to build up a complete (albeit very small) and
        launchable domain application.</p><p>Finally, note that as well as the icons needed for the example
        project, a set of additional icons are also copied (under
        <code class="computeroutput">src/main/resources/images</code>).
        Developers are free to deploy these icons into production, but only
        for when running on an NOA-compliant framework.</p></div></body></html>
