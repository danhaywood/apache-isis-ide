        large part on Eclipse's own plug-in project wizard. However the first
        page (shown above) is new, requiring the developer to enter the
        application project containing the domain objects that this project
        will provide the fixtures for. This application project name is used
        to derive the name of the fixture project itself, as well as setting
        up the classpath of the project.</p><p>Whereas the classpath of the application project is minimal, the
        classpath for the fixture project is somewhat larger. In particular it
        depends upon a number of projects from the NOF runtime. The primary
        reason for this is that the JavaFixture superclass is part of the NOF,
        rather than in the <a href="ch02s03.html#NO-Applib">Naked Objects application
        library</a>.</p><p>As well as setting up the skeleton of the project, the wizard
        also creates fixtures for the domain classes of the example created by
        the application project wizard.</p></div></body></html>
