      different projects, the most important of which is the applicaiton
      project. This contains the domain objects and supporting services that
      make up the application. The <a href="ch04s01s01.html#ApplicationProjectWizard">Application Project Wizard</a>
      allows you to quickly create a simple 3-class sample application with
      the classpath and other resources correctly set up.</p><p>Use <code class="computeroutput">File&gt;New&gt;Project...&gt;Naked
      Objects</code> to list the NO IDE's project wizards. Select
      the <code class="computeroutput">Application Project</code> wizard and
      press <code class="computeroutput">Next</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="resource/new-project-application-wizard-selected.gif"></div><p>This brings up the first page of the wizard. In the
      <code class="computeroutput">Project name</code> field, enter a name for
      the project, and change any other settings. Then press
      <code class="computeroutput">Next</code>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="resource/application-project-wizard-page-1.gif"></div><p>On the second page, adjust the
      <code class="computeroutput">Version</code> and
      <code class="computeroutput">Provider</code> if required, and then
      <code class="computeroutput">Next</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="resource/application-project-wizard-page-2.gif"></div><p>On the third and final page, ensure the <code class="computeroutput">Generate
      sample code</code> checkbox is ticked, and press
      <code class="computeroutput">Finish</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="resource/application-project-wizard-page-3.gif"></div><p>The wizard copies example code and icons to create the new
      project. When it is done the application workbench will be displayed,
      showing the project:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="resource/application-project-in-workbench.gif"></div><p>There are a couple of things to note. First and most obviously is
      the layout of the workbench itself, which is as defined by the new <a href="ch04s02.html#NO-Perspective">Naked Objects perspective</a>. This
      perspective brings together all the most useful views provided by the NO
      IDE. Second, the project has a <a href="ch04s09s02.html#NO-Nature">Naked Objects
      nature</a> (note the small 'N' overlay on the project); various other
      features of the NO IDE enable themselves based upon the presence of this
      nature. Third, note that the project that has has been created is in
      fact an OSGi (or plugin) project, hence the manifest in the editor
      area.</p><p>Let's now look at the generated code in the
      <code class="computeroutput">Package Explorer</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="resource/application-project-project-explorer.gif"></div><p>The application project includes a very simple (3 class) domain
      object model, along with 3 supporting <a href="ch02s06.html#Services">repositories</a>. These make a good starting point
      for any new application - just refactor them and modify them as
      required. Note also the provided images, with names matching the
      classes.</p><p>Although the application project is the most important of the
      projects to create, it isn't possible to run the client yet. For that we
      need both a <a href="ch01s02.html#TutorialFixtureProject">fixture
      project</a> and a client project.</p></div></body></html>
