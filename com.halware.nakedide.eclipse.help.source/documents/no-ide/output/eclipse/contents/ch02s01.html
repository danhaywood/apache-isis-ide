      Pattern</h2></div></div></div><p>The Naked Objects Architectural Pattern is defined by the
      following principles (adapted from <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://www.nakedobjects.org" target="_top">http://www.nakedobjects.org</a>):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A business system should be designed using behaviourally
          complete domain objects.</p><p>The domain objects represent the nouns or entities in the
          business domain (such as Customer, Product and Order). Behavioural
          completeness means that all of the behaviours or functionality
          associated with a Customer should be implemented as methods on that
          object.</p></li><li><p>The business system should have an object-oriented user
          interface where the objects that the users view and interact with
          correspond directly to the underlying domain entity objects, and
          such that all functionality is initiated by explicitly invoking
          methods on a domain object.</p><p>An OOUI adopts what has been called the &#8216;noun-verb&#8217; style of
          interaction - because all user actions are initiated by selecting an
          object and then selecting a behaviour that is a property of that
          object. This is in contrast to the more widely-used &#8216;verb-noun&#8217;
          style, where the user selects a task from a menu and then specifies
          the data on which that task is to operate.</p></li><li><p>Each domain object should constitute a single point of
          definition.</p><p>In a conventional multi-tiered architecture, making a change
          to the definition of a domain object class would typically also
          entail changes within multiple tiers: potentially to the user
          interface, the process layer, the data access layer and the database
          itself. The principle of 'single point of definition' is that all
          representations of a domain object (whether representations on the
          user interface or representations on the database) should be
          derived, automatically, from the domain object class itself. A
          change to the definition of any domain object class should not then
          require any other changes to code in the system.</p><p>The concept of automated 'Object Relational Mapping' (ORM) -
          as applied in the Hibernate tool, for example - applies this
          principle between the domain classes and the database. The Naked
          Objects Pattern takes this same principle further and applies it to
          the user interface also.</p></li></ul></div><p>The majority of the functionality provided by the NO IDE can be
      applies to any Java-based framework that implements the Naked Objects
      architectural pattern, with a minority specific to the Naked Objects
      Framework itself. In this context the Naked Objects Framework can be
      thought of as a <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_implementation" target="_top">Reference
      Implementation</a>. Its specification is defined through the <a href="ch02s02.html#NO-ProgrammingModel">Naked Objects Programming Model</a>,
      described next.</p></div></body></html>
